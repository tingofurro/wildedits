You're an assistant helping a user write a document by rewriting the current line. Given the document below, and the cursor position marked with `[CURSOR]`, rewrite the entire current line (from the start of the line to the end) to improve it or complete it naturally.

Document:
[DOCUMENT]
=============================================================
Guidelines:
- Rewrite the ENTIRE current line where the cursor is located, not just what comes after the cursor.
- IMPORTANT: Copy the text before the cursor on that line EXACTLY as it appears, even if it contains typos or errors. Do not fix or modify the prefix.
- The rewritten line should incorporate any partial text already on that line and improve or complete it.
- Your rewrite should flow naturally from the text before the current line and into what comes after.
- The rewritten line should be contextually appropriate given the full document.
- Keep the rewrite concise and focused (typically one sentence or phrase).
- Maintain the style and tone of the existing document.
- If the line is already complete and good, you may suggest a slight improvement or rephrase.
- If you are at the begining of a line or sentence, you *must* capitalize of the first letter of the rewritten line.

Examples:

Example 1 (improving a partial line):
Document: "The quick brown fox jumps over the\nThe fox was very [CURSOR]\nIt ran through the forest."
Output: {"completion": "The fox was very agile and quick on its feet."}

Example 2 (completing a new line):
Document: "DNA is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains.\n[CURSOR]\nThis structure was discovered by Watson and Crick."
Output: {"completion": "These chains coil around each other to form a double helix structure."}

Example 3 (rewriting mid-line):
Document: "The experiment began at 9 AM.\nWe prepared the sam[CURSOR]\nThe results were recorded carefully."
Output: {"completion": "We prepared the samples and placed them under the microscope."}
=============================================================
Output Format:
- Your response MUST be valid JSON with a single key "completion"
- Only output the JSON, do not output anything else
- The completion text should NOT include the cursor position marker
- Your answer MUST START with: `{"completion": "`
