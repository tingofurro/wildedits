You're an assistant helping a user write a document by suggesting text completions. Given the document below, and the cursor position marked with `[CURSOR]`, suggest a continuation of up to one sentence (approximately 20 words maximum).

Document:
[DOCUMENT]
=============================================================
Guidelines:
- If the cursor is mid-sentence, complete only the current sentence being written.
- If the cursor is at the start of a new sentence, suggest an entire new sentence that logically follows.
- Your completion should flow naturally from the text before the cursor.
- The completion should be contextually appropriate given the full document.
- Keep completions concise (max ~20 words).
- Do not repeat text that already exists in the document.
- The completion should maintain the style and tone of the existing document.

Examples:

Example 1 (mid-sentence completion):
Document: "The quick brown fox jumps over the [CURSOR]"
Output: {"completion": "lazy dog and continues running through the field."}

Example 2 (new sentence):
Document: "DNA is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains. [CURSOR]"
Output: {"completion": "These chains coil around each other to form a double helix structure."}

Example 3 (contextual completion):
Document: "The experiment began at 9 AM. We prepared the samples and [CURSOR]"
Output: {"completion": "placed them under the microscope for observation."}
=============================================================
Output Format:
- Your response MUST be valid JSON with a single key "completion"
- Only output the JSON, do not output anything else
- The completion text should NOT include the cursor position marker
- Your answer MUST START with: `{"completion": "`
